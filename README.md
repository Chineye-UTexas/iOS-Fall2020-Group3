Deviations: 
For each deviation, explain why it occurred. 
Firebase connectivity is not as strong or consistent as we would like it to be. Our category sections are inconsistent when it works.
We need more edge case checking regarding our photo uploading correctly into Firebase.
UI components for the Post Form page need to accommodate the lists of instructions better for our users.
The Single Post View page needs more edge case checking and a better method of leaving the page. 
User profile and saved projects list donâ€™t pull data from firebase, because we wanted to make sure post was good to go consistently

Deviations:
Feed currently uses preset data and images that we added in the Assets folder, we still have to link the post information up to Firebase; need to improve the layout constraints
For Settings page, need to figure out the implementation for allowing users to change their profile pictures
The user profile does not have any pictures or a collection view for the images, but just a basic layout
Single post display needs to fetch data from Firebase based on postID instead of hard code
Single post page needs review section and a switch the view comments or reviews, now just displays comments
